                <h2>start with our free coding challenge</h2>
                <p>In this 5-day mini-course we'll show you how to build a simple mini-website in HTML & CSS, host it
                    online for free and connect a custom domain name. You don't need any previous experience, fancy
                    software or technical know-how to complete this challenge -- just a web browser and an open mind!

                <p>When you finish learning the basics of coding in the 7-day challenge, show us your finished projects
                    and we'll share free access to a workshop on how to land your own paid client - using the networks &
                    skills that you already have. You can expect to earn anywhere from $100 - $200 for your first
                    project.</p>

                <h2>get paid & re-invest in yourself</h2>
                <p>When you get paid from your first client projects, you can re-invest in yourself taking your skills
                    to the next level, first with our web dev foundations course where you learn how to build not just a
                    mini-landing page but a complete website and then with our digital bootcamp where you learn
                    everything you need to know to build advanced websites from scratch & start a your own web
                    development agency. At each stage we'll show you how to land clients, and get paid to continue your
                    education.</p>
